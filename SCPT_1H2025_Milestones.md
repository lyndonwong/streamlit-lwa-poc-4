### II. Key Projects and Initiatives
#### A. 2045 General Plan Reset
*   **Purpose:** The General Plan Reset aims to update the city's General Plan to accommodate anticipated growth and development until 2045, as the current plan is reaching its development capacity. This project does not change zoning heights or land use designations. (SCPT_2025-02-03_transcript.txt, 0:11:39; SCPT_2025-05-05_transcript.txt, 0:11:39)
*   **Development Projections (SCPT_2025-02-03_transcript.txt, 0:16:04):**
    *   **Housing Units:** A net increase of over 8,000 units is projected by 2045, resulting in a total of 20,770 units. These projections are derived from Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) cycles, ongoing specific plans (Northeast Area Specific Plan and Downtown Specific Plan), and remaining areas of the city. (0:17:17, 0:47:21)
    *   **Population:** A corresponding net increase of over 15,000 residents is expected. (0:13:26)
    *   **Commercial/Office/R&D/Industrial:** A net increase of approximately 5 million square feet of commercial, office, research and development, and industrial space is projected. (0:17:21)
    *   **Unprecedented Interest:** The city is experiencing "an unprecedented interest in R&D sector because of the life science and biotech industries wanting development in San Carlos." (0:34:54)
    *   **Buffer for Demand:** The projections are designed to be "generously sized" to "keep that buffer that in case you know we have more demand than we are anticipating we do not need to go back and update our general plan again for the next 20 years." (0:50:09)
*   **Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) (SCPT_2025-02-03_transcript.txt):**
    *   **Programmatic Document:** The EIR is a "programmatic level evaluation," not for specific projects, meaning it looks at impacts on a high-level. (0:26:17, 0:33:00)
    *   **Significant and Unavoidable Impacts:** Four areas were identified as having significant and unavoidable impacts: air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, transportation, and wildfire. This is primarily due to the programmatic nature of the document, making it difficult to fully reduce impacts at this level. (0:26:29, 0:28:06) Project-level analysis will address these impacts with mitigation measures. (0:27:01, 0:28:51)
    *   **Less Than Significant Impacts:** Energy, hydrology and water quality, noise, parks, public services, and utilities were found to have less than significant impacts, often due to existing regulations and standards. (0:40:20, 0:41:43)
    *   **Baseline:** The baseline for the General Plan assumes projects under review as part of existing conditions, such as the Alexandria project. (0:34:31)
*   **Amendments to General Plan (SCPT_2025-02-03_transcript.txt, 0:16:46; SCPT_2025-05-05_transcript.txt, 0:12:51):**

*   **Historic Resource:** The existing two-story building is eligible for individual historic listing, as confirmed by a historic resource evaluation and peer review. (0:17:01, 0:17:14)
*   **AB 2097 Impact:** AB 2097 applies to any project, meaning parking requirements could be removed for future development on the site. (0:25:04, 0:30:46)
*   **Site Suitability:** The project meets minimum standards and is consistent with the general plan and municipal code. (0:17:49)
*   **Access and Setbacks:** Current Laurel Street access is sufficient for fire and ADA requirements. While there's no setback requirement between the new parcels, design consideration for the historic building would be encouraged. (0:26:10, 0:27:26, 0:29:41)
*   **PTC Approval:** The PTC approved the tentative parcel map. (0:39:53)

#### I. Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Budget

*   **City Hall Roof:** Solar panels were not included in the plans for the City Hall roof replacement. (0:54:04)
*   **Sidewalk Repair Program:** A very popular program that often has a long waiting list due to limited funding. (1:03:52)
*   **Adult Community Center Kitchen:** Remodeling supported due to the center's popularity and delicious meals. (1:05:06)
*   **Highway 101 Interchange:** Dollars allocated for improvements at this dicey intersection for cyclists and pedestrians, while maintaining efficient traffic flow. (1:09:44)
*   **Transparency:** The CIP budget document serves as an accomplishment record, showing past projects, completed items, and future schedules, contributing to transparency. (1:09:03)
*   **City Council Adoption:** The formal adoption of the budget was anticipated for June 9th. (0:43:55)

### III. City-Wide Transportation and Parking Initiatives
#### A. City-wide Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and Parking Management Strategies
*   **Overall Goal:** To manage current and future parking resources effectively and reduce car dependency, in light of state law changes (AB 2097) and regional policies (MTC Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) policy). (SCPT_2025-04-07_transcript.txt, 2:41:19, 2:46:03)
*   **MTC TOC Policy Compliance:** Essential for the city to remain eligible for One Bay Area grant funding. (2:46:03)
*   **Parking Maximums (SCPT_2025-04-07_transcript.txt, 2:45:45):**
    *   **Tiered System:** Recommending two tiers of parking maximums within the transit district. Developments can automatically reach Tier 1; Tier 2 requires public benefits (e.g., shared parking, funds for TDM). (2:46:15)
    *   **Elimination of Minimums:** The MTC TOC policy requires eliminating all parking minimums in the transit district. (2:48:48, 2:55:00)
    *   **Suburban District:** Maintaining parking minimums, with minor modifications to align with industry standards. (2:49:02)
    *   **Overall Cap:** A total parking space cap dictated by the General Plan's development projections for each district. (2:48:09)
    *   **Feasibility:** Tiers aim for a "sweet spot" to encourage development while aligning with policy, acknowledging that some developers may find the maximums challenging. (2:47:45, 3:25:37)
*   **Bicycle Parking (SCPT_2025-04-07_transcript.txt, 2:49:48):** Updating city code to increase bicycle parking requirements, based on industry best practices.
*   **Parking Design Standards:** Minor modifications to stall dimensions to slightly tighten them, aligning with urban land institute standards. (2:50:56)
*   **Off-Street Parking Reforms (SCPT_2025-04-07_transcript.txt):**
    *   **Unbundled Parking:** Requiring the separate pricing of parking from unit/leasing costs to lower vehicle ownership and reduce cost burden on non-car owners. (2:52:04, 3:02:10)
    *   **Publicly Accessible Parking:** Codifying the right for the city to require a percentage of private non-residential parking to be publicly accessible, primarily during non-operating hours. (2:53:07) This is a powerful but rarely used tool. (2:53:27)
    *   **Shared Parking:** Encouraging the utilization of existing parking resources (e.g., CalTrain lots) before building new parking. (2:52:42)
*   **On-Street Parking Management (SCPT_2025-04-07_transcript.txt, 2:55:34):**
    *   **Flexibility for Staff:** Giving the Director of Public Works flexibility to manage and adjust on-street parking regulations as needed, with public input and council oversight. (2:55:34, 3:21:50, 3:23:21)
    *   **Parking Benefit Districts:** Allowing for the creation of these entities to return parking revenues to the district for transportation investments. (2:59:12)
    *   **Pricing:** Introducing pricing strategies for on-street parking, with annual monitoring and adjustment, and clear guardrails for rates. (2:58:05)
*   **Residential Permit Parking (RPP) (SCPT_2025-04-07_transcript.txt, 2:59:57):**
    *   **Proposed Changes:** Lowering the number of permits per household (from 6 to 4) and introducing a cost recovery model instead of free permits.
    *   **Enforcement:** Recommendations for enforcement by community service officers or a third party. (3:02:30)
*   **TDM Ordinance Rewrite (SCPT_2025-04-07_transcript.txt, 3:04:45):**
    *   **Goals:** Calibrate trip reduction performance targets, streamline the TDM plan checklist, and improve monitoring and reporting. (3:07:58)
    *   **Targets:** ADT reduction targets ranging from 25-35% based on location (transit vs. suburban), project size, and land use type. (3:09:29, 3:39:40) Small and 100% affordable housing projects would be exempt. (3:09:01)
    *   **Strategies:** A menu of TDM strategies, with a mix of required and optional measures, focusing on those with significant trip reduction benefits. (3:16:28, 3:42:16)
    *   **Monitoring and Reporting:** Creating a standardized checklist and exploring better data collection systems (e.g., commute.org) to track progress. (3:14:14, 3:32:42)
*   **Transportation Management Association (TMA):** The city is forming a TMA to coordinate transportation management amongst developers and the city, particularly for shuttles and shared resources. (2:43:55, 3:59:33)
